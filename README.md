## Easy to Use

* Using a stack, place the divider over your containers.
* Uses the values of the widths or heights to place the handle over the edge of the container.
* Resize the containers using the return message when the handle is moved.
* The message routine is simple, see examples, and is esssentially the same for all situations.
* Make a table easily, you have full control of the content and styling.
* Tables can have headers or footers, no restrictions.
* Note on padding:  
    Padding cannot be used on the outer container in the stack because the divider
    can't detect whether padding is used causing alignment issues.  Therefore, 
    place the stack in a container and apply padding as needed.
